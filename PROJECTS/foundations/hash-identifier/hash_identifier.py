Identify what kind of hash a string is, by inspecting its shape

When someone hands you a string of gibberish like
`5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99` or `$2b$12$EixZaYVK1fsbw1ZfbX3OXe...`,
the first question is: what algorithm produced it? You can NOT crack
or analyze a hash without knowing what flavor of hash you are looking
at. Every cracking tool — hashcat, john the ripper — needs you to
specify an algorithm before it will start

This script does the looking-at part. Given a hash string, it returns
ranked candidates with a confidence score and a short reason

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
How identification actually works
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
There is no magic here. Hash strings carry shape clues

  1. PREFIX. Many modern hashes are stored in "PHC string format" —
     a self-describing format that starts with a marker like `$2b$`
     (bcrypt) or `$argon2id$` (Argon2id). When we see a known prefix
     we know the algorithm with HIGH confidence

  2. LENGTH. Raw hex output of a hash function is always the same
     length: MD5 produces 16 bytes = 32 hex chars; SHA-1 produces 20
     bytes = 40 hex chars; SHA-256 produces 32 bytes = 64 hex chars,
     and so on. Length alone narrows the field

  3. CHARSET. Different formats use different alphabets. Hex hashes
     use only 0-9 and a-f. Base64 uses 0-9, A-Z, a-z, +, /, and =.
     A string with `+` in it is not a hex hash

So our algorithm is: try prefix rules first, fall back to length +
charset rules, return the candidates ranked by confidence

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What this script can and cannot do
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CAN:    suggest likely algorithms for a hash you found
CANNOT: tell you the password the hash was made from
        (that is hashcat's job — see ../../beginner/hash-cracker)

    ---------
    Whitespace is trimmed from `raw_input` first. Then the six
    matching steps below run in order — each step's labeled comment
    (`# ----- Step N: ... -----`) inside the function body matches
    the number in this list, so the docstring and the code stay in
    lockstep:

    1. Walk the PREFIX_RULES table. The first prefix that matches
       wins (HIGH confidence). Each table row is unique enough that
       at most one entry can match a given input
    2. Check special non-PHC formats in order — NetNTLMv1/v2
       challenge-response records, MySQL5 (`*<40 hex>`), and the
       legacy 13-char DES crypt. Each has a distinctive shape that
       takes precedence over generic length-based matching
    3. If the input is pure hex, look up its length in
       HEX_LENGTH_RULES and report each candidate. The first entry
       at each length gets MEDIUM confidence (the modern default);
       the rest LOW
    4. If the input has a `$<algo>$...` shape but no PREFIX_RULES
       row matched, fall back to a generic PHC string match — LOW
       confidence because we only matched the shape, not a specific
       rule
    5. If the input looks like a JWT (`eyJ...`) or a base64 blob
       (contains `+`, `/`, or `=`), say so with LOW confidence —
